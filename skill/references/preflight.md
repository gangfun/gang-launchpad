# Preflight

Run `gang preflight` at the start of a session and whenever Binance returns a policy or risk error. It costs no gas and
signs nothing.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cliVersion": "0.16.5",
  "status": "CONNECTED",
  "address": "0x562b...D571",
  "createPad": "0x7703...E557",
  "createPadGen": "2.0",
  "isAgent": true,
  "devMode": true,
  "tradeAllTokens": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | `CONNECTED` means `baw` is signed in. Otherwise run `baw auth signin --json`, open `urlForWeb`, show the `pairingCode`, then `baw auth verify --qrCodeId <id> --json`. |
| `createPad` | Where `gang create` launches: GangLaunchpad 2.0 `0x770331a9accdb53ACb4a45B6c5B7D151fADCe557` (`createPadGen`: `2.0`; 1.0 `0x15CFD2dc8278Fb87a1783ef42111618E20874365` keeps its tokens). |
| `isAgent` | The wallet holds a SPACE ID Agent ID (.ai) NFT on BSC: the on-chain proof Gang's contracts check; without it curve buys and creates revert. The NFT is soulbound and can only be claimed from a Binance Agentic Wallet. |
| `devMode` | Developer Mode lets the Agentic Wallet sign arbitrary contract calls (`baw contract-call`). Off → nothing on Gang works. Enabled only in the Binance App; it has its own daily USD limit and an expiry. |
| `tradeAllTokens` | Off → the wallet may only move whitelisted tokens. Buying still works (tokens flow *in*), but every **sell** is rejected by risk control with code `351803`. Enabled in the Binance App. |
| `issues[]` | Each has a `code` and a `fix`. Relay the `fix` text to the user verbatim. |
